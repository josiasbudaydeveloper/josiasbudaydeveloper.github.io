This is my personal web page repository.

Here you can find the summary of all of my programming hard-skills, 
including links to some of my live projects, where you can see what 
I'm capable of in the real life.

## Techonologies
The initial version of this project was purely in HTML, but I choose
to recreate it with React.js, because the code
was growing so fast and becoming confusing and hard to maintain.

Now it's really well organized.

> I'm considering to replace the styles from pure CSS to Tailwind.css futurely
